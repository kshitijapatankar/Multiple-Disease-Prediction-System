# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System

About the Project : 
Using Machine learning models create a model that can predict multiple diseases. The model will be trained and tested using datasets from Kaggle.Web App is developed using Python’s Streamlit library.


Requirements: • Python 3.x • Kaggle Datasets • Jupyter Notebook


Libraries: • Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis • NumPy: for numerical computing • Scikit-learn: for machine learning models and evaluation • Pickle: for saving the model • Streamlit: for building the web app


Procedure: • Import the necessary libraries and the diabetic and heart disease datasets. • Split the data into features and target variables. • Split the data into training and testing sets. • Train the model on the training data. • Save the model using the pickle module. • Use Streamlit to create a web application that allows users to input their own data and make predictions using the saved model. • Include a button in the application to process the user input and make predictions.
